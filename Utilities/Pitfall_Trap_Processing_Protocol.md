Materials to keep onsite at the field:

* Low-toxicity antifreeze (propylene glycol)
* Pitfall traps
* Hand shovels
* Gloves
* Site flags
* Plastic sampling cups and lids
* Labelling materials

Field set-up for pitfall traps:

* Each site has 2 pitfall traps: a treatment pitfall trap and a control pitfall trap.
* The treatment pitfall trap is located directly underneath the light pole (0m). The control pitfall trap is located ~5m away from the light pole and marked with a red/pink flag.

Pitfall trap maintenance:

* Pitfall traps should be flush with the ground to provide unimpeded entry for insects 
	* If they are not, use the hand shovel in the wagon to dig the hole a bit deeper. Place the pitfall trap back in the hole to check if it is at ground level. If not, repeat the process. 
*  Make note of any pitfall traps that have been removed or tampered with (ex. date, site, control/treatment)

Prep plastic sample cups for pitfall traps:

1. Obtain 24 plastic sample cups with lids
1. Half fill a plastic sample cup with anti-freeze in the fume hood using protective gloves and goggles. Put the lid on the cup.
1. Stick the label on the plastic sample cup 
	* The label should be for the following sampling period. 
1. Repeat for the other 23 plastic sample cups
1. Place the 24 plastic sample cups into the wagon for the next collection period

Pitfall trap sample collection:

1. Fill wagon with extra pitfall traps, 1 anti-freeze bottle, 1 hand shovel, 1 pair of gloves, site flags, a sharpie, and ALL 12 pre-labeled/pre-filled sampling cups with lids.
* Head to site 1 with the wagon
	* Start with either the treatment or control pitfall trap, tending to only one pitfall trap at a time within a site
	* Carefully pick up the pitfall trap and open the lid to avoid spilling the contents inside (this is esp. important if it recently rained)
	* Pick up the plastic sample cup inside the pitfall trap and put a plastic lid on it, making sure it is properly closed before placing it in the wagon
	* Obtain the pre-labeled sample cup containing anti-freeze from the wagon, remove the lid, and place it inside the pitfall trap you just collected the sample from
		* Ensure the label on the plastic cup corresponds to the pitfall trap you are tending to and replacing
	* Move onto the second pitfall trap within the site
* Repeat at all other sites
* Once you have visited all 12 sites, make sure there are 24 sample cups in the wagon before returning to the field station
* Leave the wagon in the field station and move all 24 sample cups into the designated bag/box to transport to the lab for processing

Processing collected samples:

1. Take a plastic sample cup and remove the label. Place the label on the edge of the petri dish lid (ex. 2023-06-01_1_C_0m → site 1 0m). 
	* Note: petri dishes are marked with sharpie (ex. Site 1 0m) to ensure that the sample cup label matches with that of the petri dish
	* If the label’s adhesive gets stuck on the sample cup, then stick the label onto the petri dish using clear packing tape.
* Grab a tray, marked anti-freeze bottle, sieve, funnel, paintbrush, and tweezers from the clear bin under the computer. Set the tray on the countertop and all other materials on top of or around the tray. 
* Pour the insects in the sample cup into the sieve, draining the anti-freeze into the marked jug using a funnel. Rinse the insects in the sieve with a little water to remove excess antifreeze.
	* Remove any slugs from the sample cup before pouring the contents into the sieve, ensuring there are no other insects stuck to the slugs body.
* Place the empty sample cup on the scale and record the weight. Transfer the insects in the sieve to the sample cup, making sure to check for small insects left behind in the sieve. Use a paint brush to remove all small insects in the sieve.
* Place the sample cup with the insects on the scale and record the weight.
* Transfer the insects in the sample cup to the labelled petri dish.
	* If it's a large sample then a second petri dish may be required. Grab an extra petri dish and ensure that it is labelled correctly before adding insects to it. Keep petri dishes of the same sample together. Do not use petri dish lids to place insects for scan.
* Set the petri dish aside and repeat the process for the rest of the sample cups.
* Once all sample cups have been processed, take the petri dishes into the fume hood and begin flipping the insects on their back as the scanner takes pictures from below.
* Wash all materials (cups, petri dishes, tweezers, funnel, etc) with a washcloth and set aside to dry.
	* DO NOT use the abrasive (green) side of a sponge to wash the petri dishes as it scratches them, reducing the quality of scans and requiring replacement.
	
Scanning samples:

1. Turn the insects on the petri dish on their back (the scanner takes a picture from below). Place the petri dish on the scanner and close the scanner.
* Set the scanner to the settings below and scan the contents on the petri dish
	* Document size 5.39*10.2 in (width of petri dish but maintaining most document length), scaled down to 81%
	* Brightness 50%
	* Contrast 15%
* Name the file after the label on the petri dish
	* If it is a large sample and more than one scan is needed to capture all the contents, then add a ‘_0X’ to the end of label
* Label the vial.
	* Note: Multiple petri dishes of the same sample usually require a large, glass vial with a black lid. Be sure not to cram large samples into small vials as the insects do not preserve as well. 
* For larger insects, use tweezers to add them to the vial. For smaller insects, it works to add ethanol to the petri dish and collect them into the ethanol using a paint brush. Once the insects are collected into the little pool of ethanol, use the small funnel to pour them into the vial. 
* Add additional ethanol to the vial to complete submerge insects if required.
* Place a lid on the vial and set aside for storage.
* Repeat the process for the rest of the petri dishes.
* Once all petri dishes have been scanned and the contents have been stored, wash all the petri dishes with a washcloth. 
	* Over time the sharpie on the side of the petri dish may come off. Be sure to rewrite the site # and 0/5m on the side as needed.
